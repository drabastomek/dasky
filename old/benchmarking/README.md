# Dask Interactive Bencharmking

Informal benchmarking of interactive Dask on Azure ML with various VM sizes and # of nodes. 

More formal benchmarking is WIP. Mainly using this folder to store runs with different compute targets for comparison later as I use Dask. If you'd like to run a benchmark, use `base.ipynb`, make sure all the settings are correct and don't conflict with existing resources (compute target name, vm size), and run all cells.  

Skips the Pandas and local Dask sections of `example.ipynb`.
